# Star Tracker
This repository represents our star tracker implemention in python for exercise 1 in the _Intro To New Space course_.
Below you will find the explanation about the algorithm that we used with the help of our instructor, and examples.

## Part 1

## Part 2

## Part 3

## Part 4

## Installation and Run
Our star tracker uses these python packages: cv2, numpy, scipy.spatial, PIL.
If you want to run the code then look at the detect.py file for example
```sh
import cv2
import numpy as np
from Algorithm import *
algo = Algorithm()
dst_inliner, src_inliners = algo.run(image1='pics/fr1.jpg', image2='pics/fr2.jpg')
```
